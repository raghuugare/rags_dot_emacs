# My baby emacs config...

My settings and learnings (`.emacs.d`) pertaining to the awesome [**GNU Emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)! &lt;3 :)

If you are a complete beginner to Emacs, I would suggest you go through some of the following excellent resources:

+ Xah Lee's [ErgoEmacs blog](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/blog.html)
+ Mickey Petersen's awesome "[Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org)" book & eponymous site which has [a section for Emacs beginners](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/beginners-guide-to-emacs)
+ Sacha Chua's [Emacs Beginner Resources](http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/04/emacs-beginner-resources/) which records many other interesting links 
+ The book **"An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp"** by _Robert Chassell_ for a novice-friendly introduction to help learn Emacs Lisp.

Also, some of the Emacs Starter Kits that you can take a look at for information and inspiration are as below:

Emacs Starter Kit |  Author
:-----------------|:--------
[**Prelude**](http://batsov.com/prelude/) | Bozhidor Batsov, known for [CIDER](https://cider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Clojure IDE that Rocks)
[**Steve Purcell's Emacs config**](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) | Steve Purcell (an avid open-source maintainer, including for [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/))
[**John Wiegley's Emacs config**](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs) | John Wiegley (known for use-package, ledger, & lots more)

## Installation

This is more of a learning experiment for myself. So, please feel free to make your own customizations as you may deem fit.
And as for Emacs, there is no dearth of customization options!

Intended to be used in-lieu of a raw `.emacs.d` folder.

That is, simply run the following and fire up Emacs(version 25.x.y as tested):

```
git clone https://github.com/raghuugare/rags_dot_emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

**Caveats & Warnings**

+ Make sure you have backed up your existing `.emacs.d` folder first!

Enjoy Emacs !!! üíüüòá
