My settings and learnings (`.emacs.d`) pertaining to the awesome [**GNU Emacs**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)! &lt;3 :)

If you are a complete beginner to Emacs, I would suggest you go through some of the following excellent resources:

+ Xah Lee's [ErgoEmacs blog](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/blog.html)
+ Mickey Petersen's awesome "[Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org)" book & site which has [a section for Emacs beginners](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/beginners-guide-to-emacs)
+ [Sacha Chua's Emacs Beginner Resources](http://sachachua.com/blog/2014/04/emacs-beginner-resources/) which records many other interesting links

Also, some of the Emacs Starter Kits that you can take a look at for information and inspiration are as below:

Emacs Starter Kit |  Author
:-----------------|:--------
[**Prelude**](http://batsov.com/prelude/) | Bozhidor Batsov, known for CIDER (Clojure IDE in Emacs)
[**Steve Purcell's Emacs config**](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) | Steve Purcell (an avid open-source maintainer, including for MELPA)
[**John Wiegley's Emacs config**](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs) | John Wiegley (known for use-package, ledger, & lots more)

## Installation

This is more of a learning experiment for myself. So, please feel free to make your own customizations as you may deem fit.

Intended to be used in-lieu of a raw `.emacs.d` folder.

That is, simply run the following and fire up Emacs(version 24.5.1 as tested):

```
git clone git@gitbucket.com:raghuugare/rags_dot_emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
```

**Caveats & Warnings**

+ Make sure you have backed up your existing `.emacs.d` folder first!

Enjoy Emacs !!! üíüüòá
